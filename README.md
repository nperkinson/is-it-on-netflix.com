# is-it-on-netflix.com

A React site using GatsbyJS's Eventually to provide users the ability to search for any movie and tv show found between the five services: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, and Disney+. [Visit it here](https://is-it-on-netflix.com).

Coming soon
- Would like to add site URL direction (if supported) to the specific media
- Adding more site options
- Fixed REST interaction that handles feeding into Python then back to highlight the site result
- Possibly shift from Python to alternate backend (unless I want to keep fiddling with a VS Code errors)
- Animations
- Textual list of results that allow (on hover) highlighting of relevant site
- Heavy CPU usage
